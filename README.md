# Simple Stock System
This is the final year dissertation project for BSc (Hons) Computer Science.

# Project Description
This project is a Python desktop application, made with Tkinter as the UI framework, and MySQL to setup the database, and SQL as the querying language.
It's purpose is to provide the user (ideally a novice investor/stock trader) with helpful information and signals that can be used to help the user make educated decisions for their trading activities, in order to reduce the losses due to irresponsible trading and a general lack of knowledge.

This application aims to use the MACD indicator, and subsequently the MACD crossover strategy in order to provide the user with signals for their selected timeframe.
The user is able to select their stock and timeframe combination from a selection of 49 stocks, and 3 timeframes, "5MIN", "30MIN" and "1 HOUR".
